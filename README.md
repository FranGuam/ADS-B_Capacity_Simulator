# ADS-B Capacity Simulator

This program simulates the capacity of an ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) communication system by analyzing the probability of message collisions and the time intervals between messages. The simulation is performed for different numbers of aircrafts transmitting messages on a shared communication channel.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
